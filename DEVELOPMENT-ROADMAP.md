## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### Known Issues from Architecture Validation
1. **Missing Reservation States**: Current enum only has PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED. Architecture requires DRAFT, PENDING_PAYMENT, EXPIRED, REFUNDED.
2. **Payment Integration**: Payment service is placeholder only.
3. **No Password Hashing**: Passwords stored in plain text (User entity).
4. **Race Conditions**: No pessimistic locking on availability.
5. **No Frontend**: Complete UI missing.

### Technical Debt
- JPA entities not annotated (using in-memory repositories currently)
- No input validation on many DTOs
- No comprehensive error handling
- No logging framework configured
- No monitoring/observability
